SQL -Procedure
============

**A pl-sql Procedure does not return any value. Procedure has two sections;**

-   **Declaration of the procedure:** Declaration of procedure always start with
    a keyword create ends with last **variable parameters**.

-   **Body of the procedure:** Body of procedure starts with a keyword called
    **is or as** and ends with end statement.

Example
```sql
create or replace procedure p1(a in number, b out number, c out number, d out number)
is
	begin;
	    select ename, sal, deptno, into b, c, d from emp where empno=a;
	end;
```


### Function

A PL/SQL Function is a self control block which is used to perform some specific
task. **function must always return a value**, but a procedure may or may not
return a value.
```sql
create or replace function add(a number, b number)
return number
is
number;
begin;
 	a:=10;
  	b:=20;
  	c=a+b;
return c;
end;
```

**Package** is a collection of sub-programs that means function or procedure
```sql
create package package_name AS
   procedure procedure_name(parameter);
end package_name;
```


### Cursors 

A Cursors is a temporary work area created in the system memory when a SQL
statement is executed. It is a temporary memory which is used to fetch more than
one record at a time from existing table.

- **Implicit cursor** cursor is perform by the system internally

- **Explicit cursor** This type of cursor is performed by the user manually or
programatically

### Steps to perform cursor

| **Steps**                            | **Syntax**                            |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Declare the cursor**               | **open cursor_name;**                 |
| **Open the cursor**                  | **open cursor_name;**                 |
| **Fetch the record from the cursor** | **fetch cursor_name into variables;** |
| **Close the cursor**                 | **close cursor_name;**                |

**Declare the cursor**
```sql
declare
a emp %rowtype;
cursor c is select * from emp where depno=&deptno;
begin
open c;
loop fetch c into a;
if c % found then
dbms_output.put_line(a.empno || ' ' a.ename || ' ' || a.sal);
else
exit;
end if;
end loop;
close c;
end;
```

### **Trigger**

Trigger is a pl/sql block structure which is fired when a DML statements like
Insert, Delete, Update is executed on a database table. A trigger is triggered
automatically when an associated DML statement is executed

**Purpose of Triggers**

Triggers can be written for the following purposes:

-   Generating some derived column values automatically

-   Enforcing referential integrity

-   **Event logging and storing information on table access Auditing**

-   Synchronous replication of tables

-   **Imposing security authorizations**

-   To avoid invalid transactions

-   To generate the resulting data automatically.

**Part of Trigger**

A database trigger has 5 parts.

-   Trigger timing

-   Trigger event or statement

-   Trigger level

-   Trigger restriction

-   Trigger body

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER trigger_name 
 {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF } 
 {INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE} 
 [OF col_name] 
 ON table_name 
 [REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n] 
 [FOR EACH ROW] 
 WHEN (condition)  
 BEGIN 
   --- sql statements  
 END;
```


**Write a trigger to stop delete operation on emp_table**
```sql
create or replace trigger mytrigger
before
delete
on emp
begin
raise_application_error(-20000, 'sorry we can not delete any record from this table');
end;
```
