Ansible – Ad-hoc Commands
=========================

An Ansible ad-hoc command uses the **/usr/bin/ansible** command-line tool to
automate a single task on one or more managed nodes. Ad-hoc commands are great
for tasks you repeat rarely.

for example, if you want to power off all the machines in your lab for Christmas
vacation, you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a
playbook.

**Syntax**  
```yaml
ansible [hsotpattern] -m [module] -a "[module options]"
```

Ad-hoc tasks can be used to reboot servers, copy files, manage packages and
users etc.

Ex \#1 - I want to re-boot all [web] servers
```yaml
Ex #1 - I want to re-boot all [web] servers
ansible web -a "/sbin/reboot"

Ex #2 - By default Ansible uses only 5 simultaneous processes, I have 100 Servers - To reboot the [web] servers with 10 parallel forks/processes
ansible web -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10
```


**Copy Module** :   used for transfer files from Master to host nodes.
```yaml
\# To transfer a file from Ansible master to all servers in the [web] group:
ansible web -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts"
```


**File Module** : used for Create/Copy/Delete files or folders from Hosts
```sql
# file module allows changing ownership and permissions on files.
ansible web -m file -a "dest=/srv/foo/a.txt mode=600"
ansible web -m file -a "dest=/srv/foo/b.txt mode=600 owner=mdehaan group=mdehaan"

#The file module can also create directories, similar to mkdir -p:
ansible web -m file -a "dest=/path/to/c mode=755 owner=mdehaan group=mdehaan state=directory"

#To delete directories (recursively) and delete files:
ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/path/to/c state=absent"
```


**yum Module**: to install, update, or remove packages on managed nodes
```sql
# To ensure a specific version of a package is installed:
$ ansible webservers -m yum -a "name=acme-1.5 state=present"

# To ensure a package is at the latest version:
$ ansible webservers -m yum -a "name=acme state=latest"

# To ensure a package is not installed:
$ ansible webservers -m yum -a "name=acme state=absent"
```

**user Module**: create, manage, and remove user accounts
```sql
$ ansible all -m user -a "name=foo password=<crypted password here>"
$ ansible all -m user -a "name=foo state=absent"
```


**service Module**: start/stop services
```sql
# Ensure a service is started on all webservers:
$ ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

# restart a service on all webservers:
$ ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted"

# Ensure a service is stopped:
$ ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped"
```



Ansible – Command Line Tools
----------------------------

1.**ansible**  
Used to Define and run a single task ‘playbook’ against a set of hosts. Mostly
we used this for running Ad-hoc commands
```sql
ansible web -a "/sbin/reboot"
```


2.**ansible-config**  
View ansible configuration.

```dos
vagrant@master:~/Ansible$ ansible-config --version
ansible-config 2.9.4
config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
configured module search path = [u'/home/vagrant/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins
/modules']
ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible
executable location = /usr/bin/ansible-config
python version = 2.7.6 (default, Nov 13 2018, 12:45:42) [GCC 4.8.4]
```


3.**ansible-console**
a REPL that allows for running ad-hoc tasks against a chosen inventory


4.**ansible-doc**  
displays information on modules installed in Ansible libraries. It displays
    a terse listing of plugins and their short descriptions, provides a printout
    of their DOCUMENTATION strings, and it can create a short “snippet” which
    can be pasted into a playbook.


5.**ansible-galaxy**
command to manage Ansible roles in shared repositories, the default of which
    is Ansible Galaxy https://galaxy.ansible.com.


6.**ansible-inventory**
 used to display or dump the configured inventory as Ansible sees i


7.**ansible-playbook**
 Runs Ansible playbooks, executing the defined tasks on the targeted hosts.


8.**ansible-pull**
pulls playbooks from a VCS repo and executes them for the local host


9.**ansible-vault**
encryption/decryption utility for Ansible data files
