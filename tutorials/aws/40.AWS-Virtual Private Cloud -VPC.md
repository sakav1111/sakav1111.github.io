Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
===========================

**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** enables you to launch Amazon Web Services
(AWS) resources into a virtual network that you've defined.

A "Virtual Private Cloud" is a sub-cloud inside the AWS public cloud. Sub-cloud
means it is inside an isolated logical network. Other servers can't see
instances that are inside a VPC.

-   When an user register for AWS account, the VPC for that user is Created

-   All the Instances launch by that user is reside inside his VPC

-   So, for each User , his own VPC is there to play with aws Services

-   If we open VPC dashboard we already have a VPC, with tenancy : Default.

-   That means that on creating AWS account by default one VPC is created

-   all the S3 Buckets, instances we created will be created inside Default VPC

-   You have complete control over your virtual networking environment,
    including a selection of your IP address range, the creation of subnets, and
    configuration of route tables and network gateways.

-   Applications run in the VPC or on-premises

-   Subnets can be created in the VPC

    -   Public subnets - Opens to outside internet

    -   Private subnets - Inside Communication

-   Direct Connect provides VPN(Virtual Private Network) connections

-   Multiple VPCs can be connected by VPC pairing

-   VPC endpoints connect to Amazon resources which are outside the VPC

Endpoint - Kind of jump - direction of next connection

-   Dynamic private IP

-   Dynamic public IP

-   AWS-provisioned DNS names

-   Private DNS names

-   Public DNS names

### VPC Architecture

-   We have VPC inside Region – us-est-1

-   outside the VPC, we have **internet gateway and virtual private gateway**.

-   Both these connections go to the router in a VPC and then router directs the
    traffic to the **Route Table**.

-   Route table will then direct the traffic to **Network ACL**(kind of firewall
    or security groups)

-   We have two instances – each have their own **security groups** & their own
    **public, private subnets.**

In public subnet, the internet is accessible by an EC2 instance, but in private
subnet, an EC2 instance cannot access the internet on their own
