Simple Storage Service (S3) 
============================

-   It is Object-based storage, i.e., you can store the images, word files, pdf
    files, etc.

-   The files which are stored in S3 can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.

-   It has unlimited storage means that you can store the data as much you want.

-   Files are stored in Bucket. A bucket is like a folder available in S3 that
    stores the files.

-   S3 is a universal namespace, i.e., the names must be unique globally. Bucket
    contains a DNS address. Therefore, the bucket must contain a unique name to
    generate a unique DNS address.

-   If you create a bucket, URL look like:

    ![AWS S3](media/c3458b2092a361b3de1c4d1c6a8356e9.png)

-   If you upload a file to S3 bucket, then you will receive an HTTP 200 code
    means that the uploading of a file is successful.

-   Supports encryption and automatic data classification(S3 to Glacier if data
    not using for 3 months)

### S3 Concepts

**S3 is object-based. Objects consist of the following:**

-   **Buckets - Container for storing files**

-   **Regions** - if we create bucket, we must put it in a region where users
    can frequently access

-   **Objects** - Just Files

-   **Keys** - Each Object has a Key. Kind of file name.

-   **Object URLs** - Share Object publicly via URL

-   **consistency** - It data modified in one region automatically updated in
    other regions

-   **Key:** It is simply the name of the object. For example, hello.txt,
    spreadsheet.xlsx, etc. You can use the key to retrieve the object.

-   **Value:** It is simply the data which is made up of a sequence of bytes. It
    is a data inside the file.

-   **Version ID:** Version ID uniquely identifies the object

-   **Metadata:** It is the data about data that you are storing. A set of a
    name-value pair with which you can store the information regarding an
    object.

-   **Subresources:** Subresource mechanism is used to store object-specific
    information.

-   **Access control information:** You can put the permissions individually on
    your files.

*Very Good example use of S3 is "static website hosting”, it will have a Object
URL*

### How S3 Storage Works

Before adding any data in S3 the user must create a bucket which will be used to
store objects.

-   A Bucket is a logical unit of storage in S3(like Folder).

-   A Bucket contains objects which contain the **data** and
    **metadata(Key+version+etc)**.

When you are creating a Bucket keep note about below factors

-   Pricing

-   User/Customer Location - make sure bucket is near to user access location

-   Latency - less distance – good latency

-   Service Availability
