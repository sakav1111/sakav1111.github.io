SSH is used to connect Remote Servers from Your System & do Operations. But how will you tell your system is Secure to Connect & perform Operations ?

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet.

It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.

If youâ€™re using Linux or Mac, then using SSH is very simple. If you use Windows, you will need to utilize an SSH client to open SSH connections. The most popular SSH client is PuTTY

The SSH command consists of 3 distinct parts
ssh {user}@{host}

When you hit enter, you will be prompted to enter the password for the requested account.  If your password is correct, you will be greeted with a remote terminal window.

There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH:
1.	Symmetrical encryption
2.	Asymmetrical encryption
3.	Hashing.
