# Ubuntu - How To Change Apache2 Default Port

#### Change Apache port on Debian/Ubuntu

Edit **/etc/apache2/ports.conf** file,
```powershell
sudo vi /etc/apache2/ports.conf
```


Find the following line:  
`Listen 80`

And change it to a random number of your choice, for example **8090**.  
`Listen 8090`

This entry make the server to accept connections on port 8090 on all interfaces.

To make the server accept connections on port 8090 for a specific interface,
just include the corresponding network interfaceâ€™s IP address as shown below.  
`Listen 192.168.1.101:8090`

This will be helpful if your server has multiple IP addresses or network
interfaces.

Save and close the file.

<br>

Additionally, in Ubuntu and Debian, you also have to change the port number
in **/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf** file too.
```powershell
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```


Find the following line and change the port number.
```powershell
<VirtualHost *:8090>
```


Save and close the file.

<br>

Then, restart Apache service to take effect the changes.

```powershell
sudo systemctl restart apache2
        or
sudo service apache2 restart
```
<br>

Now let us verify the port settings:
```powershell
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :8090

Sample output:
tcp6    0   0 :::8090   ::: LISTEN  4066/apache2
```


Then, open your web browser and navigate to URL: **http://IP-address:8090**.

You should see the following screen:
