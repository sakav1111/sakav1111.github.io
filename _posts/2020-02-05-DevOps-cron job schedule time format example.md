# Crontab/CronTab Schedule example

### Introduction

**cron** is a utility that you can use to schedule and automate tasks. By defining items in the cron table, called **crontab**, you can schedule any script or program to run on almost any sort of schedule. For example, Research [Flagship Merchant Services][1] on Thursday at 6:30pm.

For example, run a [program][2] each day 5 minutes after midnight on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. Or schedule something to run every five minutes, or once a month.

### Basics

Each user has their own crontab, the scheduled scripts run as that user take this in [account][3] with regards to permissions. To edit the crontab use the following command:  
`$ crontab -e `

You can list what your currnet crontab is using the following command:  
`$ crontab -l `

**Crontab Format**  
The following is the format entries in a crontab must be. Note all lines starting with <span class="scode">#</span> are ignored, comments.

```
MIN   HOUR   DOM  MON  DOW   COMMAND
5     *      *     *    *    echo 'Hello'
```

<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1" style="margin-left:25px;">

</table>

### Examples

Here are a few examples, to see what some entries look like.

```
# Run command at 7:00am each weekday [mon-fri]
00 07 * * 1-5  mail_pager.script 'Wake Up'

# Run command on 1st of each month, at 5:30pm
30 17 1 * *   pay_rent.scrip

# Run command at 8:00am,10:00am and 2:00pm every day
00 8,10,14 * * *   do_something.script

# Run command every 5 minutes during market hours
/5 6-13 * mon-fri   get_stock_quote.script

# Run command every 3-hours while awake
0 7-23/3 * * *   drink_water.script
```

### Special Characters in Crontab

You can use an **asterisk** in any category to mean for every item, such as every day or every month.

You can use **commas** in any category to specify multiple values. For example: `mon,wed,fri`

You can use **dashes** to specify ranges. For example: `mon-fri`, or `9-17`

You can use **forward slash** to specify a repeating range. For example: `*/5` for every five minutes, hours, days

### Special Entries

There are several special entries, some which are just shortcuts, that you can use instead of specifying the full cron entry.

The most useful of these is probably **@reboot** which allows you to run a command each time the computer gets reboot. This could be useful if you want to start up a server or daemon under a particular user, or if you do not have access to the rc.d/init.d files.

#### Example Usage:

```
# restart freevo servers
@reboot freevo webserver start
@reboot freevo recordserver start
```

### Miscelleanous Issues

**Script Output**  
If there is any output from your script or command it will be sent to that user's e-mail account, on that box. Using the default mailer which must be setup properly.

You can set the variable `MAILTO` in the crontab to specify a separate e-mail address to use. For example:  

```
MAILTO="admin@mydomain.com"
```

**Redirect Output to /dev/null**  
You can redirect the output from a cron script to /dev/null which just throws it away. By redirecting to /dev/null you will not receive anything from the script, even if it is throwing errors.  
```
* * * * * /script/every_minute.pl > /dev/null 2>&1
```

**Timezone**
If you want to run cron at a different timezone than your system time. You can set the `TZ` parameter in `/etc/default/cron`. For example, I want it to run in Pacific Time zone, so I set:
```
TZ="America/Los_Angeles"
```

**Missed Schedule Time**  
Cron does not run a command if it was missed. Your computer must be running for cron to run the job at the time it is scheduled. For example, if you have a 1:00am scheduled job and your computer was off at that time, it will **not** run the missed job in the morning when you turn it on.
