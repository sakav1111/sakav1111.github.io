JasperReports is an open-source reporting tool for Java that is used for reporting of applications. This reporting tool helps in writing rich content onto the screen, to the printer, or into a variety of files like HTML, PDF, XLS, RTF, CSV, XML, ODT and TXT.

JasperReports can also be used for Java-enabled applications like Java EE or web applications to generate dynamic content.

Install JasperReports

install Jasper Reports Community edition **from Here.**

Structure of Jasper Reports
===========================

A **.jrxml** report template is consist of the following parts shown in the below figure.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*urqw8V-cmPX-co7EqzgaeQ.png)

1\. **Title** contains the 'Title' of the report. It appears **only once** at the very beginning of the report. or example, Title of the report is "Student Report"

2\. **PageHeader** may contain date and time information or organization name. This appears at the **top of each page**. For example: Page header heading will be "Student Records"

3\. **Column Header** lists the names of those specific fields, which you want to display in the report, For example, "Student Id," "Student Name," "Student Address" etc.

4\. **Detail** is the part where entries of the specific fields are shown. For example, Student Id=101, Student Name="Den Peek", Student Address="Pune"

5\. **ColumnFooter** may display Sum of any of the field. For example, "Total Hours Study: 6 hours in a day"

6\. **PageFooter** may contain page count information. It appears at the bottom of each page, For example, "Page Number is 1,2,3 and all"

7\. **Summary:** Summary of the report, at last one time for a report.

JasperReports --- Life Cycle
==========================

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:696/1*TuFMOb9FsJAu4sEX0qy9YQ.png)

-   **Designing the report** - In this step we, create the JRXML file, which is an XML document that contains the definition of the report layout.
-   **Compiling the report** - In this step, JRXML is compiled in a binary object called a Jasper file (*.**jasper**).
-   **Filling data into the report** - In this step, data from the application is filled in the compiled report. The class net.sf.jasperreports.engine.**JasperFillManager** provides necessary functions to fill the data in the reports. A Jasper print file (*.**jrprint**) is created, which can be used either to print or export the report.
-   **Exporting Report** - In this step, we can export the Jasper print file created in the previous step to any format using **JasperExportManager**.

API Classes
-----------

There are number of classes, which will be used to compile a JRXML report design, to fill a report, to print a report, to export to PDF, HTML & XML files etc.

Which are present in(**net.sf.jasperreports.engine**) package

*-* ***JasperCompileManager*** *--- Used to compile a JRXML report template.*

*-* ***JasperFillManager*** *--- Used to fill a report with data from the data source.*

*-* ***JasperPrintManager*** *--- Used to print the documents generated by the JasperReports library.*

*-* ***JasperExportManager*** *--- Used to obtain PDF, HTML, or XML content for the documents produced by the report-filling process.*

DataSources
-----------

Datasources are structured data container. While generating the report, JasperReports engine obtains data from the datasources. Data can be obtained from the databases, XML files, arrays of objects, and collection of objects.

The table given below summarizes the datasources and their implementation classes -

Jasper Reports data elements
============================

Parameter: $P
-------------

> $P{parameter_name)

- it is used for single values on the report.

- The data which cannot be passed through the data source, can be passed by using parameters. Data like title of the report, etc.

- A JasperReports template or JRXML template can have zero or more parameter elements.

Field: $F
---------

> $F{field_name}

- Report fields are elements, which represent mapping of data between datasource and report template.

- it is used to change the value on every iteration, or we can say it is used to represent a row data in the table

Variable: $V
------------

> $V{variable_name}

- it is provided by jasper report.

- it is also used to perform some calculation on jasper report like arithmetic operations ,etc.

Steps to Create any Jasper Report
=================================

1\. **Desig Template**, copy. jrxml file to Spring Resources folder

2\. Create Required **Parameters**

3\. Create **DataSource**

4\. **Compile** .jrmxl template, stored in JasperReport object

5\. **Fill Report** --- by passing complied .jrxml object, paramters, datasource

6\. **Export Report** --- by using JasperExportManager
