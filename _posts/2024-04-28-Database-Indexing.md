Database Indexing 

What is an Index?
An index in a database is similar to an index in a book. It provides a quick way to look up data based on the values of certain columns. Without an index, the database would have to scan every row in a table to find the rows that meet a certain condition, which can be slow for large tables.

How Indexes Work:
When a query is executed, the database engine first checks if there is an index that can be used to satisfy the query.
If an index exists, the database engine uses it to quickly locate the rows that meet the query conditions.
Without an index, the database engine must scan the entire table to find the relevant rows.

Considerations:
Indexes consume storage space, so it's important to balance the performance benefits with the storage overhead.
Indexes need to be maintained whenever data in the indexed columns is inserted, updated, or deleted, which can impact write performance.
Regularly monitor and optimize indexes to ensure they are providing the expected performance benefits.
