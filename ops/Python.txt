Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons ';'
Python uses on indentation(Tab) or whitespace to define scope - such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages curly-brackets - "{ }" for this purpose.

To check if you have python installed or not
python --version

helloworld.py
print("Hello, World!")


C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py

if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":
C:\Users\Your Name>py helloworld.py
