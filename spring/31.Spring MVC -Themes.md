Spring MVC - Themes
======================

Themes in an application can be define as overall **look-and-feel**. Basically,
theme is a collection of **static resources like images, CSS etc.** For using
theme in your application, you must use
interface **org.springframework.ui.context.ThemeSource. ThemeSource** is
extended by the *WebApplicationContext* interface 

Buut real work is done by the implementation of
**org.springframework.ui.context.support.ResourceBundleThemeSource** that loads
properties files from the root of the classpath.

Using ResourceBundleThemeSource, you can define a theme in properties file. You
need to make a list of resources inside property file. Given below a sample :
```xml
styleSheet=/themes/cool/style.css
background=/themes/cool/img/coolBg.jpg
```


The keys of the property file represent the themed element of view. For example
: in JSP, you can use <spring:theme> custom tag to refer a themed elements.
Given below the sample code :
```html
<%@ taglib prefix="spring" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags"%>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<spring:theme code='styleSheet'/>" type="text/css"/>
</head>
<body style="background=<spring:theme code='background'/>">
...
</body>
</html>
```

the properties files are loaded from the root of the classpath.

### Theme resolvers

After defining theme, you decide which theme to use.
The *DispatcherServlet* look for a bean named *themeResolver*to determine which
implementation of *ThemeResolver* to use. It detects the theme for a specific
request and can also modify the theme of the request.

Spring have following theme resolvers:

| **Class**                   | **Description**                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FixedThemeResolver**      | This theme resolver picks fixed theme which can be set using *defaultThemeName* property.       |
| **SessionThemeResolver**    | This theme resolver is used to set the theme for a whole session but not for different session. |
| **CookieThemeResolver**     | This theme resolver set the selected theme in a cookie for each client.                         |
| **ThemeChangeInterceptor** | This theme resolver changes theme on every request having a simple request parameter            |
