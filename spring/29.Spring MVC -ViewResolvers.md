Spring MVC - ViewResolvers
============================

In Spring MVC or any web application, for good practice, it’s always recommended
to put the entire views or JSP files under “**WEB-INF"** folder, to protect it
from direct access via manual entered URL.

Those views under **“WEB-INF" folder are named as internal resource views**, as
it’s only accessible by the servlet or Spring’s controllers class.

We have many ViewResolver classes in Spring MVC. Below are the some of those

-   **InternalResourceViewResolver**

-   **XmlViewResolver**

-   **ResourceBundleViewResolver**

### 1.InternalResourceViewResolver

**InternalResourceViewResolver** is used to resolve “internal resource view" (in
simple, it’s final output, jsp or htmp page) **based on a predefined URL
pattern**. In additional, it allows you to add some predefined prefix or suffix
to the view **name (prefix + view name + suffix),** and generate the final view
page URL

1.A controller class to return a view, named “**WelcomePage**“.
```java
public class WelcomeController extends AbstractController{	
	@Override
	protected ModelAndView handleRequestInternal(HttpServletRequest request,
 HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception {
 ModelAndView model = new ModelAndView("WelcomePage"); 
 return model;
	}
}
```


2.Register **InternalResourceViewResolver** bean in the Spring’s bean
configuration file.
```xml
<beans>
<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.support.ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping" />
	<!-- Register the bean -->
	<bean class="controller.WelcomeController" />

	<bean id="viewResolver"
    	      class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver" >
              <property name="prefix">
                  <value>/WEB-INF/pages/</value>
               </property>
              <property name="suffix">
                 <value>.jsp</value>
              </property>
        </bean>
</beans>
```

Now, Spring will resolve the view’s name “**WelcomePage**" in the following way:

**prefix + view name + suffix = /WEB-INF/pages/WelcomPage.jsp**

Similarly, we have **XmlViewResolver & ResourceBundleViewResolver**, both have
their own way of resolving the Views.
