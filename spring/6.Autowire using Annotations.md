Spring â€“ Autowire using Annotations
=====================================

Starting with Spring 2.5, the framework introduced a new style of Dependency
Injection driven by *@Autowired* Annotations. This annotation allows Spring to
resolve and inject collaborating beans into your bean.

To enable Annotation based autowiring we need to place below line in
SpringConfig.xml

```xml
<context:annotation-config/>
```
Once annotation injection is enabled, autowiring can be used on properties,
setters, and constructors.

<br>

**1. @Autowired on Properties**
```java
public class Student {	 
	private int sno;
	private String name;
	
	@Autowired
	private Address address;

}
```


2.**@Autowired on Setters**
```java
public class Student {
	private int sno;
	private String name;

	private Address address;

	@Autowired
	public void setAddress(Address address) {
 this.address = address;
	}
}
```

**3. @Autowired on Constructors**
```java
public class Student {
	private int sno;
	private String name;

	private Address address;
	
	@Autowired
	public Student(Address address) { 
 this.address = address;
	}	 
}
```


**4.@Autowired and Optional Dependencies**
Spring expects *@Autowired* dependencies to be available when the dependent
bean is being constructed. If the framework cannot resolve a bean for wiring, it
will throw **NoSuchBeanDefinitionException.** To avoid this we have to use
**(required=false)** 
```java
public class Student {	 
	private int sno;
	private String name;
	
	@Autowired(required = false)
	private Address address;
}
```

By default, the @Autowired annotation implies the dependency is required
similar to @Required annotation, however, you can turn off the default behavior
by using **(required=false)** option with @Autowired.



**5.Autowiring by @Qualifier**  
By default, Spring resolves *@Autowired* entries by type. If more than one
beans of the same type are available in the container, the framework will throw
a fatal exception indicating that more than one bean is available for
autowiring.

To avoid this error we have to use @Qualifier.

Now we can update SpringConfig.xml by removing `autowire="byType"` , because we are using `@Autowired` annotation
```xml
<beans>

 <bean id="student" class="core.Student" autowire="byType">
 	<property name="sno" value="101"></property>
 	<property name="name" value="Satya Kaveti"></property>
 </bean>

 <bean id="address" class="core.Address">
 	<property name="hno" value="322"></property>
 	<property name="city" value="HYDERABAD"></property>
 </bean>


 <bean id="address1" class="core.Address">
 	<property name="hno" value="322"></property>
 	<property name="city" value="HYDERABAD"></property>
 </bean>
</beans>
```

In above you have multiple bean of same type, Container will confuse which bean
should inject & throws **NoSuchBeanDefinitionException:**
`by: *org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException*: No unique
bean of type [core.Address] is defined: expected single matching bean but found
2: [address, address1]`

To fix above problem, you need **@Qualifier** to tell Spring about which bean
should autowired.
```java
public class Student {
	private int sno;
	private String name;
	@Qualifier("address")
	private Address address;
}
```
