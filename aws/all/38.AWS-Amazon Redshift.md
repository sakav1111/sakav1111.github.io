Amazon Redshift
===============

**Amazon Redshift** is a fully managed data warehouse service in the cloud. Its
datasets range from 100s of gigabytes to a petabyte. The initial process to
create a data warehouse is to launch a set of compute resources
called **nodes**, which are organized into groups called **cluster**. After that
you can process your queries.
