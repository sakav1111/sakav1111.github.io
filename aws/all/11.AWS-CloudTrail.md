CloudTrail
==========

With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity
related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.

CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including
actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools,
and other AWS services.

This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and
troubleshooting.Â In addition, you can use CloudTrail to detect unusual activity
in your AWS accounts.
