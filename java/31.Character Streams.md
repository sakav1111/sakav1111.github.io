2.Character Streams
====================

Character stream I/O automatically translates this internal format to and from
the local character set. here the data is read by character by character

**1. FileReader** is meant for reading streams of characters

**2. FileWriter** is meant for writing streams of characters

Here Methods & Constructors are Similar to Byte Stream, but **instead of byte
they will char data.** used for reading/writing data from/to **Files by
character encoding**.

Example
```powershell
public class CharacterStreams {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		String filepath = "E:\\users\\Kaveti_s\\Desktop\\Books\\tmp.txt";
		char[] ch ={ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' }; 
		FileWriter w = new FileWriter(filepath);
			w.write(ch); //accepts char type only
			w.close();		

		FileReader r= new FileReader(filepath);
		int i;
		while ((i = r.read()) != -1) {
			System.out.println(i+":"+(char)i);
		}
	}
}
-------------------
97:a	98:b	99:c	100:d	101:e
```

Here we can read file data. Data stored in the file is **abcde**

If we pass int data to FileWriter the program will execute without Compilation
Error but it doesnâ€™t display any Output / Empty Output
