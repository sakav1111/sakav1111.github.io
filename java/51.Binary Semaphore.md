2.Binary Semaphore(Mutex)
==========================

A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it only has at most
one permit available, can serve as a mutual exclusion lock. This is more
commonly known as a binary semaphore, because it only has two states: **one
permit available, or zero permits available**.

When used in **this** way, the binary semaphore has the property (unlike many
Lock implementations), that the "lock" can be released by a thread other than
the owner (as semaphores have no notion of ownership). This can be useful in
some specialized contexts, such as deadlock recovery.

**Mutex** â€“ Only one thread to access a resource at once. Example, when a client
is accessing a file, no one **else** should have access the same file at the
same time.

Mutex is the Semaphore with an access count of 1. Consider a situation of using
lockers in the bank. Usually the rule is that only one *person is allowed to
enter the locker room.*
```java
public class SemaphoreTest {

	// max 1 people
	static Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(1);

	static class MyLockerThread extends Thread {

		String name = "";

		MyLockerThread(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}

		public void run() {

			try {

				System.out.println(name + " : acquiring lock...");
				System.out.println(name + " : available Semaphore permits now: " 
								+ semaphore.availablePermits());

				semaphore.acquire();
				System.out.println(name + " : got the permit!");

				try {

					for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
		System.out.println(name + " : is performing operation " + i 
								+ ", available Semaphore permits : "
								+ semaphore.availablePermits());
						// sleep 1 second
						Thread.sleep(1000);
					}

				} finally {
					// calling release() after a successful acquire()
					System.out.println(name + " : releasing lock...");
					semaphore.release();
                    System.out.println(name + " : available Semaphore permits now: "+ semaphore.availablePermits());
				}

			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}

	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

	System.out.println("Total available Semaphore permits : " + semaphore.availablePermits());

		MyLockerThread t1 = new MyLockerThread("A");
		t1.start();

		MyLockerThread t2 = new MyLockerThread("B");
		t2.start();

		MyLockerThread t3 = new MyLockerThread("C");
		t3.start();

		MyLockerThread t4 = new MyLockerThread("D");
		t4.start();

		MyLockerThread t5 = new MyLockerThread("E");
		t5.start();

		MyLockerThread t6 = new MyLockerThread("F");
		t6.start();

	}
}
```
