Insertion Sort
==================

We take an unsorted array for our example.

![Unsorted Array](media/bc756135be3cd502cc085e9d4e80d9e6.jpg)

Insertion sort compares the first two elements.

![Insertion Sort](media/018ebd7ff95a6e06a59ad0a8ab3b38fb.jpg)

It finds that both 14 and 33 are already in ascending order. For now, 14 is in
sorted sub-list.

Insertion sort moves ahead and compares 33 with 27.

And finds that 33 is not in the correct position.

It swaps 33 with 27. It also checks with all the elements of sorted sub-list.
Here we see that the sorted sub-list has only one element 14, and 27 is greater
than 14. Hence, the sorted sub-list remains sorted after swapping.

By now we have 14 and 27 in the sorted sub-list. Next, it compares 33 with 10.

These values are not in a sorted order.

So we swap them.

However, swapping makes 27 and 10 unsorted.

![Insertion Sort](media/773a26fc1cc69637aaeba6bc5b676d88.jpg)

Hence, we swap them too.

![Insertion Sort](media/9233aea5c49d780830e1bc75c88e820c.jpg)

Again we find 14 and 10 in an unsorted order.

![Insertion Sort](media/f1b6ab21ac6db37a1d6ede7912f2b5f1.jpg)

We swap them again. By the end of third iteration, we have a sorted sub-list of
4 items.

This process goes on until all the unsorted values are covered in a sorted
sub-list. Now we shall see some programming aspects of insertion sort.

<u>Algorithm</u>  
Now we have a bigger picture of how this sorting technique works, so we can
derive simple steps by which we can achieve insertion sort.

Step 1 − If it is the first element, it is already sorted. return 1;

Step 2 − Pick next element

Step 3 − Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list

Step 4 − Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is greater than the
value to be sorted

Step 5 − Insert the value

Step 6 − Repeat until list is sorted
