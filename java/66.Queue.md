Queue
=========

Queue is open at both its ends. **One end is always used to insert data**
(enqueue) and the **other is used to remove data (dequeue**). Queue follows
First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be
accessed first.

<u>Basic Operations</u>

-   **enqueue()** − add (store) an item to the queue.

-   **dequeue()** − remove (access) an item from the queue.

-   **peek()** − Gets the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

-   **isfull()** − Checks if the queue is full.

-   **isempty()** − Checks if the queue is empty.

<u>steps should be taken to enqueue (insert) data into a queue −</u>

-   **Step 1** − Check if the queue is full.

-   **Step 2** − If the queue is full, produce overflow error and exit.

-   **Step 3** − If the queue is not full, increment **rear** pointer to point
    the next empty space.

-   **Step 4** − Add data element to the queue location, where the rear is
    pointing.

-   **Step 5** − return success.
