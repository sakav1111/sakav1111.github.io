Java NIO(**Non-blocking I/O**)
===========================================

The java.nio.file  provide comprehensive support for file I/O and for accessing
the default file system.

**1) IO streams versus NIO blocks**

-   NIO provides high-speed, block-oriented I/O.original I/O deals with **data
    in streams**, whereas NIO deals with **data in blocks**.

-   A block-oriented I/O system deals with data in blocks. Each operation
    produces or consumes a block of data in one step. Processing data by the
    block can be much faster than processing it by the (streamed) byte

**2) Synchronous vs. Asynchronous IO**

-   Java IO’s various streams are blocking or synchronous. That means, that when
    a thread invokes a read() or write(), that thread is blocked until there is
    some data to read, or the data is fully written.

-   In asynchronous IO, a thread can request that some data be written to a
    channel, but not wait for it to be fully written. The thread can then go on
    and do something else in the meantime. Usually these threads spend their
    idle time on when not blocked in IO calls, is usually performing IO on other
    channels in the meantime. That is, a single thread can now manage multiple
    channels of input and output
```powershell
public class ReadFileWithFixedSizeBuffer
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
    {
        RandomAccessFile aFile = new RandomAccessFile"test.txt", "r");
        FileChannel inChannel = aFile.getChannel();
        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
        while(inChannel.read(buffer) > 0)
        {
            buffer.flip();
            for (int i = 0; i < buffer.limit(); i++)
            {
                System.out.print((char) buffer.get());
            }
            buffer.clear(); // do something with the data and clear/compact it.
        }
        inChannel.close();
        aFile.close();
    }
}
```

#### <u>Blocking vs. Non-blocking I/O</u>

**Blocking I/O**  
Blocking IO wait for the data to be write or read before returning. Java IO's
various streams are blocking. It means when the thread invoke a write() or
read(), then the thread is blocked until there is some data available for read,
or the data is fully written.

**Non blocking I/O**  
Non blocking IO does not wait for the data to be read or write before returning.
Java NIO non- blocking mode allows the thread to request writing data to a
channel, but not wait for it to be fully written. The thread is allowed to go on
and do something else in a mean time
