Java 7 Features(2011)
================

# Underscores in Numeric Literals (Java 7)

Java allows you to use underscore in numeric literals.

-   You cannot use underscore at the beginning or end of a number.

-   You cannot use underscore adjacent to a decimal point in a floating point
    literal.(  10._0)

-   You cannot use underscore prior to an F or L suffix
    (**long** a = 10_100_00_L;)

-   added in Java 7. You can have underscores in numbers to make them easier to
    read:
```java
int million1 = 1000000;
int million2 = 1_000_000;

double notAtStart = _1000.00; // DOES NOT COMPILE
double notAtEnd = 1000.00_; // DOES NOT COMPILE
double notByDecimal = 1000_.00; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

# String in switch statement (Java 7)
```java
public class StringInSwitchStatementExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        String game = "Cricket";  
        switch(game){  
        case "Hockey":  
            System.out.println("Let's play Hockey");  
            break;  
        case "Cricket":  
            System.out.println("Let's play Cricket");  
            break;  
        case "Football":  
            System.out.println("Let's play Football");  
        }  
    }  
}
```

# The try-with-resources (Java 7)

the try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more
resources. The resource is as an object that must be closed after finishing the
program. The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed
at the end of the statement execution.

You can pass any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable, which includes
all objects which implement java.io.Closeable

# Caching Multiple Exceptions by single catch (Java 7)

Java allows you to catch multiple type exceptions in a single catch block. It
was introduced in Java 7 and helps to optimize code.You can use vertical bar
(\|) to separate multiple exceptions in catch block.

# Diamond operator <>, removes right side of generics

you can replace the type arguments with an empty set of type parameters (<>).
This pair of angle brackets is informally called the diamond.

The following approach is used in Java 6 and prior version.
```java
Ex. List<Integer> list  = new List<Integer>();  

Now, you can use the following new approach introduced in Java 7.
Ex. List<Integer> list = new List<>(); // Here, we just used diamond
```
