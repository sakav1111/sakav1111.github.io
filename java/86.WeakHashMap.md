WeakHashMap
===============

-   It is exactly same as HashMap except following difference

-   In the case of HashMap eventhough Object doesn’t have any reference it is
    **NOT elegible** for **gc()** if it is associated with HashMap that is
    HashMap dominates Garbage collector

-   But the case of WeakHashMap if Object doesn’t have any references it is
    **elegible** for **gc()** eenthough Object associated with WeakHashMap that
    is Garbage collector dominates WeakHashMap

<u>This Temp class is common for HashMap & WeakHapMap Demo’s</u>
```java
class Temp {
	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Temp";
	}
	@Override
	protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
		System.out.println("Finalize Called");
	}
}
```

<u>HashMap Demo with GC</u>
```java
public class HashMapdemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		HashMap m = new HashMap();
		Temp t = new Temp();
		m.put(t, "Satya");
		System.out.println(m);
		t=null;
		System.gc(); 
		Thread.sleep(5000);
//main Thread Sleeping for 5 seconds 
//Garbage collector takes control for 5 seconds
		System.out.println(m);
	}
}
-----------------------
{Temp=Satya}
{Temp=Satya}
```
In the above example Temp object is not eligible for gc() because it is
associated with HashMap.in this case out put is **{Temp=Satya} {Temp=Satya}**

<u>WeakHashMap Demo with GC</u>
```java
public class WeakHashMapdemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		WeakHashMap m = new WeakHashMap();
		Temp t = new Temp();
		m.put(t, "Satya");
		System.out.println(m);
		t=null;
		System.gc(); 
		Thread.sleep(5000);
		System.out.println(m);
	}
}
-----------------------
{Temp=Satya}
Finalize Called
{}
```
In the above example Temp object is eligible for gc() because it is associated
with HashMap.in this case out put is **{Temp=Satya} Finalize Called {}**
