Thread Priority
==================

Each thread has a priority. Priorities are represented by a number between 1 and
10. In most cases, **thread scheduler schedules the threads according to their
priority** (known as preemptive scheduling). **But it is not guaranteed because
it depends on JVM specification** that which scheduling it chooses.

1.  **public static int MIN_PRIORITY //1**

2.  **public static int NORM_PRIORITY //5 (default)**

3.  **public static int MAX_PRIORITY //10**

```java
public class ThreadPriority extends Thread{
	@Override
	public void run() {
	Thread th= Thread.currentThread();	
	System.out.println("Name :"+th.getName() +"\t Priortity:"+th.getPriority());
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ThreadPriority t1 = new ThreadPriority();
		ThreadPriority t2 = new ThreadPriority();
		ThreadPriority t3 = new ThreadPriority();
		
		t1.setPriority(MIN_PRIORITY);
		t2.setPriority(NORM_PRIORITY);
		t3.setPriority(MAX_PRIORITY);
		
		t1.start();
		t2.start();
		t3.start(); 
	}
}
----------------------------------
Name :Thread-2	 Priortity:10
Name :Thread-1	 Priortity:5
Name :Thread-0	 Priortity:1
```

Even though t1 starts first, it has *MIN_PRIORITY* so, it executes last that to
depends on JVM Specification
