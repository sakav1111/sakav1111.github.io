Java 11.0.2 (Latest) Initial - September 2018, latest – Jan 2019
====================================================================

They’ve changed the licensing and support model which means if you download the
Java 11 Oracle JDK, it will be **paid for commercial use**

**Does that mean that I need to pay for Java from now on?**  
**NO.** Not necessarily unless you **download the Oracle JDK and use it in
production**

You can use it in developing stages but to use it commercially, you need to buy
a license. If you don’t, you can get an invoice bill from Oracle any day!

[Java 10](https://www.journaldev.com/20395/java-10-features)** was the last free
Oracle JDK that could be downloaded.**

## Running Java File with single command

One major change is that you don’t need to compile the java source file
with javac tool first. You can directly run the file with java command and it
implicitly compiles

## Java String Methods

**isBlank()** 
```java
     System.out.println(" ".isBlank()); //true
     
     String s = "Anupam";
     System.out.println(s.isBlank()); //false
```


**repeat(int)**  
The repeat method simply repeats the string that many numbers of times as
mentioned in the method in the form of an int.
```java
String str = "=".repeat(2);
 System.out.println(str); //prints ==
```
