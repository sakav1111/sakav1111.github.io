Synchronization
==================

Synchronization is a process of allowing only one thread at a time

**Lock**:   
Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the lock
or monitor. Every object has a lock associated with it. By convention, a thread
that needs consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's
lock before accessing them, and then release the lock when it's done with them.

<br>

**<u>Problem without Synchronization</u>**
```java
class Counter implements Runnable {
	private int count;
	@Override
	public void run() {
 for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
 	waitCounter (i);
 	count++;
 }
	}

	public int getCount() {
 return this.count;
	}
	public void waitCounter(int i) {
	try {
 	Thread.sleep(1000);
 } catch (InterruptedException e) {
 	e.printStackTrace();
 }
	}
}
public class ThreadSafety {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
 Counter c = new Counter();
 Thread t1 = new Thread(c);
 t1.start();
 Thread t2 = new Thread(c);
 t2.start();
 // wait for threads to finish processing
 t1.join();
 t2.join();
 System.out.println("Processing count=" + c.getCount());
	}
}
-----------------------
Processing count=8
```

In above example for a single thread **Counter** we created two child threads
t1,t2 and **count** is a variable common for those two threads. **After
completion of thread execution, the counter must be 10**. But **here it is
displaying output as 8** because two threads are executing parallel on same
method **waitCounter(),** the result may is overlapped two threads are executing
same method at same time.

<br>

To resolve these types of problems we use synchronization. We can implement
synchronization is **3 ways**

**1. Synchronized Instance Methods**

**2. Synchronized Static Methods.**

**3. Synchronized Blocks**

<br>

### **1. Synchronized Instance methods**: 

If the ordinary instance method is made it as **synchronized, then the object of
the corresponding class will be locked**
```java
synchronized void waitCounter(int i) {
   try {
      Thread.sleep(1000);
   } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
   }
}
```


### **2. Synchronized static method**

If an ordinary static method is made it as synchronized then the **corresponding
class will be locked**.
```java
synchronized static void waitCounter(int i) {
 try {
 	Thread.sleep(1000);
 } catch (InterruptedException e) {
 	e.printStackTrace();
 }
	}
```


### 3. Synchronized block:

When we inherit non-synchronized **methods from either base class or interface
into the derived class**, **we cannot make the inherited method as
synchronized**. Hence, we must use synchronized blocks
```java
public void waitCounter(int i) {
   synchronized (this) {
      try {
         Thread.sleep(1000);
      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }   
   }      
}
```

If you use any of above methods the output should be **Processing count=10**
