Interrupting a Thread
========================

An *interrupt* is an indication to a thread that it should stop what it is doing
and do something else. It's up to the programmer to decide exactly how a thread
responds to an interrupt, but it is very common for the thread to terminate

If any thread is in **sleeping or waiting state** (i.e. sleep() or wait()),
calling the **interrupt()** method on the thread, breaks out the sleeping or
waiting state **throwing InterruptedException**.

```java
public void interrupt() - Inturpting a Thread
```


**To Test the Status**
-   `public static boolean interrupted()` It is a Static method, tests whether
    the CURRENTLY running thread is interrupted or not

-   `public boolean isInterrupted()` : It is a instance method and tests
    whether the thread instance on which the method is invoked is interrupted or
    not

**If the thread is not in the sleeping or waiting state, calling the interrupt()
method performs normal behaviour and doesn't interrupt the thread but sets the
interrupt flag to true**

<u>Thread is Interrupted & Stops working</u>
```java
public class InterruptNormal extends Thread {
	public void run() {
		try {
			Thread.sleep(1000);
			System.out.println("task");
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			throw new RuntimeException("Thread interrupted..." + e);
		}
		System.out.println("Thread is Running ...");
	}
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		InterruptNormal t1 = new InterruptNormal();
		t1.start();
		try {
			t1.interrupt();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Exception handled " + e);
		}
	}
}
Exception in thread "Thread-0" java.lang.RuntimeException: Thread interrupted...java.lang.InterruptedException: sleep interrupted
	at threads.InterruptNormal.run(InterruptNormal.java:9)
```
above Example your are re throwing IntereuptException. So thraed is Inturrpeed &
also stops its execution

<br>

<u>Thread is Interrupted & doesn’t Stops working</u>
```java
public class InterruptHandled extends Thread {
	public void run() {
		try {
			Thread.sleep(3000);
			System.out.println(" *** Sleep is Still Running ****");
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			System.out.println("Thread interrupted..." + e);
		}
		System.out.println("Thread is Running ...");
	}
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		InterruptHandled t1 = new InterruptHandled();
		t1.start();
		try {
			t1.interrupt();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Exception handled " + e);
		}
	}
}
Thread interrupted...java.lang.InterruptedException: sleep interrupted
Thread is Running ...
```
above Example Exception is handled. It is only interruped sleeping
thraed.reaming are excuting as normal

**If thread is not in sleeping or waiting state, calling the interrupt() method
sets the interrupted flag to true that can be used to stop the thread by the
java programmer later.**
```java
public class InterruptHandled extends Thread {
	public void run() {		 
		System.out.println(" *** No Sleep is Here ****");		 
		System.out.println("Thread is Running ...");
	}

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		InterruptHandled t1 = new InterruptHandled();
		t1.start();
		try {
			t1.interrupt();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Exception handled " + e);
		}
	}
}
*** No Sleep is Here ****
Thread is Running ...
```


The interrupt mechanism is implemented using an internal **flag** known as
the *interrupt status*. Invoking interrupt() sets this flag. When a thread
checks for an interrupt by invoking the static method **Thread.interrupted**,
interrupt status is cleared. The non-static isInterruptedmethod, which is used
by one thread to query the interrupt status of another, does not change the
interrupt status flag.

By convention, any method that exits by throwing an InterruptedException clears
interrupt status when it does so. However, it's always possible that interrupt
status will immediately be set again, by another thread invoking interrupt.
