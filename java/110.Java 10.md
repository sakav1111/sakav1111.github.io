110-Java10 (mar-2018) (Java SE 10.0.2 july-18)
==============================================

## Local Variable Type Inference

Java has now var style declarations. It allows you to declare a local variable
without specifying its type. The type of variable will be inferred from type of
actual object created. It claims to be the only real feature for developers in
JDK 10
```java
var str = "Hello world";
```


## Time-Based Release Versioning

On printing java version, it just shows version number only
```java
E:\Users\Kaveti_S>java -version
java version "1.8.0_202-ea"
```


But in 10, it will show the Date of version release The new pattern of the
Version number is:
```java
$FEATURE. $INTERIM. $UPDATE. $PATCH
java version "10" 2018-03-20
```


## Garbage Collector Interface

Anyone wanting to implement a new GC would require knowledge about all these
various places, as well as how to extend the various classes for their specific
needs.
