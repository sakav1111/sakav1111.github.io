Jenkins – continuous delivery pipeline
======================================

**Differences Between Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment**

![](media/d7f8e6b3541d1103e500ef5860123155.png)

**Continuous Integration**, every code commit is built and tested, but, is not
in a condition to be released. I mean the build application is not automatically
deployed on the test servers in order to validate it using different types of
Blackbox testing like - User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

**Continuous Delivery**, the application is continuously **deployed on the test
servers for UAT**. Or, you can say the application is ready to be released to
production anytime. So, obviously Continuous Integration is necessary for
Continuous Delivery.

**Continuous Deployment** is the next step past Continuous Delivery, where you
are not just creating a deployable package, but you are actually deploying it in
an automated fashion.

## Continuous Delivery Pipeline

A pipeline is a collection of jobs. Suppose I’m developing a small application
on Jenkins and I want to build, test and deploy it.

To do this, I will allot 3 jobs to perform each process. So, job1 would be for
build, job2 would perform tests and job3 for deployment. I can use the Jenkins
build pipeline plugin to perform this task. After creating three jobs and
chaining them in a sequence, the build plugin will run these jobs as a pipeline

We are using below GitHub repo for Building pipeline

<https://github.com/wakaleo/game-of-life.git>

This is a Maven Project. We have following lifecycles in Maven

Following is the list of build phases:

-   **validate** - validate the project is correct and all necessary information
    is available

-   **compile** - compile the source code of the project

-   **test** - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing
    framework.

-   **package** - package compiled code to distributable format, such as a
    JAR/war.

-   **verify** - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure
    quality criteria are met

-   **install** - install the package into the local repository, for use as a
    dependency in other projects locally

-   **deploy** - copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing
    with other developers and projects.

Using Delivery Pipeline Plug-in
-------------------------------

**Steps Involved in the Demo**

-   Fetching the code from GitHub

-   Compiling the source code

-   Unit testing and generating the JUnit test reports

-   Packaging the application into a WAR file

-   Deploying it on the Tomcat server.

#### 1.Fetching the code from GitHub & Compile

**New Item \> Freestyle**

![](media/6f34fda43c3d1beeafdc2a410a2c1934.png)

**source code Management \> select "git" : add the repository URL**

![](media/f9368840d266ccb7212a00d2dbb2f0bf.png)

Jenkins to poll the GitHub repository after every 5 minutes for changes in the
code

![](media/85f6009cc08c9da25ee7af158bb4880e.png)

At Build Step \> Invoke top level Maven targets. we are just compiling Source
Code

![](media/8e7918952240ba5179cfa83a7e8ae8a0.png)

Save & Build Now.

![](media/c45cd63d753139db4e409ea510bb5cdc.png)

#### 2.Unit testing and generating the JUnit test reports

Now we will create one more Project for unit testing – -Gamelife-Testing”. Add
the same repository URL in the source code management tab, like we did in the
previous job.

Now, in the "**Build Trigger**" tab click on the "**build after other projects
are built**". Here we Do Unit Testing only if **GameLife-Compile** job build &
it is stable.

![](media/9d4d931f2dea159b5ccc11f1e86c0b99.png)

**Pre-Build Actions** \> Add \> invoke top level maven targets \> ‘test’ command

![](media/bfe90ce4a2715d74fce99f2ada4537fe.png)

**Post-build Actions** \> section and tick "**Publish JUnit test result
report**" checkbox.

-   When Maven runs unit tests in a project, it automatically generates the XML
    test reports in a directory called surefire-reports. Enter
    `**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml` in the "Test report XMLs" field.

-   The two asterisks at the start of the path `("**")` are a best practice to
    make the configuration a bit more robust: they allow Jenkins to find the
    target directory no matter how we have configured Jenkins to check out the
    source code.

`**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml`

![](media/b8fe4ed363487355be6a2aefb4dabf94.png)

In the Jenkins dashboard, you will also notice the test results:

#### 3.Package & Deploy WAR file 

Create ‘GameLife-Deploy’ freestyle project with Same Source Code

![](media/33f94e9bdbf74596cbdc8519c566d809.png)

**Build Triggers** \> Build after other projects are built \> Projects to watch
: **GameLife-Test**

![](media/5519b6b473496865e1887029a743b68d.png)

**Build \> Execute Windows batch command : \`mvn package\`**

![](media/c09e007f8b24322748ba5c251d4a023c.png)

Now, we are going to deploy WAR to Tomcat Server. For that

Go to **Post-build Actions \> Deploy war/ear to a container** : Give Tomcat
Details

![](media/98943adcdf9c21f9d426f7324e62bafd.png)

Save and then select Build Now

![](media/3247931141d756d9f96508776bda3609.png)

Go to your tomcat URL, with the context path. For me it is -
<http://localhost:6666/game/>

![](media/feb952023459bfdc968c36049797e9db.png)

#### 4. Configure Build Pipeline

Add : -Build Pipeline” plug-in

Go to Jenkins Home \> Click on + to add new Pipeline

![](media/e368361156d72e789a2cb31947407dc9.png)

In Details, I’m leaving as it is – just providing Initial Job

![](media/5459d59d43b2592784358a55d036ffc1.png)

If we build initial job, automatically it triggers all the jobs which are
configured in this pipeline.

![](media/c5d3470898c0d92ce4f423da65a4557a.png)

![](media/e2baba3cd1b6532026edf805095183ce.png)

#### 5. Configure Delivery Pipeline

Add : -Delivery Pipeline” plug-in

Go to Jenkins Home \> Click on + to add new Pipeline

![](media/3c3ac4def3fe02d6980b6e9bebd773be.png)

Provide Name & choose Pipeline type

![](media/c0e307c278bb87ba845655485a80a056.png)

In Details, I’m leaving as it is – just providing Initial Job

![](media/a36b3d102087b1264b0b0a12d46226bc.png)

If we build initial job, automatically it triggers all the jobs which are
configured in this pipeline.

Using Jenkinsfile
-----------------

Above approach is effective for deploying small applications. But if you have
pipelines with several processes (build, test, unit test, integration test,
pre-deploy, deploy, monitor) running 100’s of jobs?

The maintenance cost for such a complex pipeline is huge and increases with the
number of processes.To overcome this issue, a new feature called **Jenkins
Pipeline Project** was introduced.

The key feature of this pipeline is to define the entire deployment flow through
code. Instead of building several jobs for each phase, you can now code the
entire workflow and put it in a **Jenkinsfile**

It is written based on two syntaxes, namely:

1.  **Declarative pipeline syntax – Write to SCM repo**

2.  **Scripted pipeline syntax – Write on UI screen**

### Syntax

**Pipeline -**The pipeline is a set of instructions given in the form of code
for continuous delivery and consists of instructions needed for the entire build
process. With pipeline, you can build, test, and deliver the application.

**Node** - The machine on which Jenkins runs is called a node. A node block is
mainly used in scripted pipeline syntax.

**Stage** - A stage block contains a series of steps in a pipeline. That is, the
build, test, and deploy processes all come together in a stage. Generally, a
stage block is used to visualize the Jenkins pipeline process.

**Step** - A step is nothing but a single task that executes a specific process
at a defined time. A pipeline involves a series of steps.

### Example

New item \> pipeline project

![](media/77b6d2c9c87e76737e2cf6e054367d90.png)

For **Declarative pipeline** \> **Choose SCM** -provide Jenkinsfile path in
repository

![](media/4616c298545961578a2667edf0846387.png)

For Scripted pipeline – choose Script - Write Code on UI screen

```json
pipeline {
         agent any
         stages {
                 stage('One') {
                 steps {
                     echo 'Hi, this is Zulaikha from edureka'
                 }
                 }
                 stage('Two') {
                 steps {
                    input('Do you want to proceed?')
                 }
                 }
                 stage('Three') {
                 when {
                       not {
                            branch "master"
                       }
                 }
                 steps {
                       echo "Hello"
                 }
                 }
                 stage('Four') {
                 parallel { 
                            stage('Unit Test') {
                           steps {
                                echo "Running the unit test..."
                           }
                           }
                            stage('Integration test') {
                              agent {
                                    docker {
                                            reuseNode true
                                            image 'ubuntu'
                                           }
                                    }
                              steps {
                                echo "Running the integration test..."
                              }
                           }
                           }
                           }
              }
}
```
