REST -Representation State Transfer
======================================

**REpresentational State Transfer (REST)** is a stateless client-server
architecture in which the web services are viewed as **resources** and can **be identified by their URIs.** Web service clients that want to use these resources
access via globally defined set of remote methods that describe the action to be
performed on the resource.

It consists of two components

1.  **REST server:** which provides access to the resources

2.  **REST client** : which accesses and modify the REST resources.

In the REST architecture style, clients and servers exchange result
representations of resources by using a standardized interface and
protocol. **REST isn't protocol specific, but when people talk about REST they
usually mean REST over HTTP**.

The response from server is considered as the result representation of the
resources. This result representation can be generated from one resource or more
number of resources. REST allows that resources have different result
representations, **e.g.xml, json etc**. The rest client can ask for specific
result representation via the HTTP protocol

### HTTP methods: 

RESTful web services use HTTP protocol methods for the operations they perform.

Methods are:

-   **GET**: It defines a reading access of the resource without side-effects.
    This operation is idempotent i.e. they can be applied multiple times without
    changing the result

-   **PUT**:  It is generally used for updating resouce. It must also be
    idempotent.

-   **DELETE:** It removes the resources. The operations are idempotent i.e.
    they can get repeated without leading to different results.

-   **POST**: It is used for creating a new resource. It is not idempotent.

### Idempotent

Idempotent means result of multiple successful request will not change state of
resource, after initial application

**For example:**

**GET is idempotent.** If Delete() is idempotent method because when you first
time use delete, it will delete the resource (initial application) but after
that, all other request will have no result(same result) because resource is
already deleted.

**Post is not idempotent** method because when you use post to create resource,
it will keep creating resource for each new request, so result of multiple
successful request will not be same.

## Some important features of Restful web services are:

**1.Resource identification through URI**:Resources are identified by their URIs
(typically links on internet). So, a client can directly access a RESTful Web
Services using the URIs of the resources (same as you put a website address in
the browser  s address bar and get some representation as response).

**2.Uniform interface:** Resources are manipulated using a fixed set of four
create, read, update, delete operations: PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE.

**3.Client-Server:** A clear separation concerns is the reason behind this
constraint. Separating concerns between the Client and Server helps improve
portability in the Client and Scalability of the server components.

**4.Stateless:** each request from client to server must contain all the
information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of
any stored context on the server.

**5.Cache:** to improve network efficiency responses must be capable of being
labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable.

**6.Named resources** - the system is comprised of resources which are named
using a URL.

**7.Interconnected resource representations** - the representations of the
resources are interconnected using URLs, thereby enabling a client to progress
from one state to another.

**8.Layered components** - intermediaries, such as proxy servers, cache servers,
gateways, etc, can be inserted between clients and resources to support
performance, security, etc.

**9.Self-descriptive messages**: Resources are decoupled from their
representation so that their content can be accessed in a variety of formats,
such as HTML, XML, plain text, PDF, JPEG, JSON, and others.
