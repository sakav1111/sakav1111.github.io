Webservices 
============

By using webservices we can communicate different applications on different
platforms. For example java application in Windows platform can easily
communicate with the application developed using .net/php in Linux operation
system.

Web Services are mainly of 2 types,

1.  **SOAP [Simple Object Access Protocol]**

2.  **REST [Representational state transfer]**


<br>


## **1. SOAP [Simple Object Access Protocol]**

SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. **SOAP is an XML based** industry
standard protocol for designing and developing web services. **Since it’s XML
based, its platform and language independent**. So our Service can be based on
JAVA and client can be on .NET, PHP etc. and vice versa. **SOAP gives the output
only in XML format**

**We have following API’s to implement SOAP Webservices in our java
applications**

-   **JAX-WS**

-   **Apache Axis2**

-   **URI - Uniform Resource Identitier**

-   **URL - Uniform Resource Link**



## **2. REST [Representational state transfer]**

-   What ever the data/response we will get from the server is known as
    **Resource**.

-   Each resource can be accessed by its URI’s.

-   We can get the resource from RESTful service in different formats like,
    **HTML, XML, JSON, TEXT, PDF** and in the **Image formats** as well, **but
    in real time we mainly we will prefer JSON.**

-   REST guidelines always talks about stateless communication between client
    and the Server. Stateless means, every single request from client to server
    will be considered as a fresh request. Because of this reason REST always
    prefers to choose HTTP as it a stateless protocol

**We have following API’s to implement RESTful Webservices in our java
applications**

-   **JAX-RS**

Apache CXF provides implementation for SOAP and RESTful services both.

REST is a style of software architecture. RESTful is typically used to refer to
web services implementing such an architecture

| **No.** | **SOAP**                                                        | **REST**                                                                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1)      | SOAP is a **protocol**.                                         | REST is an **architectural style**.                                                                  |
| 2)      | SOAP stands for **Simple Object Access Protocol**.              | REST stands for **REpresentational State Transfer**.                                                 |
| 3)      | SOAP **can't use REST** because it is a protocol.               | REST **can use SOAP** web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP. |
| 4)      | SOAP **uses services interfaces to expose the business logic**. | REST **uses URI to expose business logic**.                                                          |
| 5)      | **JAX-WS** is the java API for SOAP web services.               | **JAX-RS** is the java API for RESTful web services.                                                 |
| 6)      | SOAP **defines standards **to be strictly followed.             | REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.                                                   |
| 7)      | SOAP **requires more bandwidth** and resource than REST.        | REST **requires less bandwidth** and resource than SOAP.                                             |
| 8)      | SOAP **defines its own security**.                              | RESTful web services **inherits security measures** from the underlying transport.                   |
| 9)      | SOAP **permits XML** data format only.                          | REST **permits different** data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON etc.                      |
| 10)     | SOAP is **less preferred** than REST.                           | REST **more preferred** than SOAP.                                                                   |
